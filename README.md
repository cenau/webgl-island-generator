# webgl-island-generator

Code is v. messy

change the seed to get new islands, most of the bits are parameterised so you can play with them in the controls

voronoi paramaters control ‘moutainessness’ - higher scale is more peaks

the fbm stuff is for noise or ‘naturalness’

the blobs let you control the shape of the island

and the mix parameters control the mix between the three
